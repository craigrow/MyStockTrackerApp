# MyStockTrackerApp - Requirements Specification (Updated)
*Updated: June 22, 2025*

## 1. Project Overview
MyStockTrackerApp is a web application designed to help investors track the performance of their stock purchases against major market indices. Users can manually enter stock purchases, sales, and dividends, organize them into multiple portfolios, and visualize how their investments compare to major market ETFs (VOO for S&P 500, QQQ for NASDAQ).

The application provides various visualizations and metrics to help users understand:
- How individual stocks perform against the indices
- How entire portfolios perform against the indices
- Daily performance comparison vs. market benchmarks
- Portfolio allocation and performance contributions

## 2. User Requirements

### 2.1 User Types
- Single-user application (future expansion to multi-user planned)
- Each user can manage multiple portfolios

### 2.2 Portfolio Management
- Create multiple portfolios within a single user account
- Toggle between different portfolios to view portfolio-specific metrics
- Enter stock purchases manually (ticker symbol, date, price per share, number of shares including fractional shares)
- Enter stock sales manually (same data points as purchases)
- Enter dividends manually (ticker symbol, date, total dividend amount)
- View performance metrics specific to each portfolio
- Cash from stock sales and dividends remains in the portfolio
- When new purchases are made, existing cash is used first before additional funds
