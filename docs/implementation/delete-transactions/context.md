# Delete Transactions Feature - Context

## Task Description
Implement the ability to delete transactions from the Transactions page.

## Project Structure Analysis
- **Framework**: Flask web application with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with JavaScript
- **Testing**: pytest with 210 existing tests
- **Architecture**: MVC pattern with services layer

## Requirements Analysis
### Functional Requirements
1. Add delete button/action to each transaction row in the transactions table
2. Implement confirmation dialog before deletion
3. Create backend API endpoint to handle transaction deletion
4. Update portfolio calculations after transaction deletion
5. Provide user feedback on successful/failed deletion
6. Maintain data integrity (recalculate holdings, performance metrics)

### Acceptance Criteria
- User can delete individual transactions from the transactions page
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Portfolio metrics are recalculated after deletion
- Deleted transactions are permanently removed from database
- User receives clear feedback on operation status
- Page refreshes/updates to show current state after deletion

## Existing Patterns
### Database Models
- `StockTransaction` model in `app/models/portfolio.py`
- Portfolio service methods in `app/services/portfolio_service.py`

### UI Patterns
- Bootstrap modals for confirmations
- AJAX calls for API interactions
- Flash messages for user feedback

### API Patterns
- RESTful endpoints in `app/views/portfolio.py`
- JSON responses with success/error status
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Implementation Paths
1. **Backend**: Add delete endpoint in portfolio views
2. **Service Layer**: Add delete method in portfolio service
3. **Frontend**: Add delete buttons and confirmation modal
4. **JavaScript**: Handle delete actions and API calls
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage

## Dependencies
- Existing portfolio service and models
- Bootstrap modal components
- jQuery for AJAX calls
- Flask flash messaging system

## Security Considerations
- Validate user permissions for transaction deletion
- Prevent deletion of transactions from other users' portfolios
- Use CSRF protection for delete operations
