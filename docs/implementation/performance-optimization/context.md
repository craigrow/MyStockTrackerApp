# Performance Optimization Implementation Context

## Project Overview

MyStockTrackerApp is a Flask-based stock portfolio tracking application with comprehensive performance optimization requirements. The application currently suffers from significant performance bottlenecks that need to be addressed.

## Current Performance Issues

- **Dashboard Load Time**: 27+ seconds (target: <3 seconds)
- **API Calls per Load**: ~19,690 (target: <100)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: ~50% (target: >95%)
- **Error Rate**: High due to timeouts (target: <1%)

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.12 + Flask + SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 + Chart.js + Vanilla JavaScript
- **APIs**: Yahoo Finance (yfinance) for stock data
- **Deployment**: Heroku free tier
- **Testing**: pytest with 233 comprehensive tests

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
1. **Batch API Processing**: Replace sequential API calls with batch requests using yfinance batch capabilities
2. **Parallel Processing**: Implement asyncio for concurrent API requests
3. **Intelligent Caching**: Smart cache warming and market-aware invalidation
4. **Background Processing**: Move non-critical operations off the critical path
5. **Progressive UI Loading**: Load dashboard components progressively
6. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement API failure protection
7. **Data Freshness Indicators**: Clear visual indicators of data status

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Dashboard load time <3 seconds (90% improvement)
- API calls reduced by 99.5% to <100 per load
- Cache hit rate >95%
- Error rate <1%
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Work within Heroku free tier constraints

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Path Optimization (Weeks 1-2)

### Models
- `app/models/price.py`: Enhance PriceHistory for caching
- `app/models/portfolio.py`: Add cache-related fields

### Views/Controllers
- `app/views/main.py`: Optimize dashboard loading
- `app/views/api.py`: Add new API endpoints for background updates

### Frontend
- `app/templates/dashboard.html`: Add progressive loading
- `app/static/js/`: Add background update handling

### New Components
- Circuit breaker implementation
- Background job scheduler
- Cache warming utilities
- Performance monitoring

## Dependencies and Integration Points

### External Dependencies

- Database models and relationships

## Constraints and Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- Heroku free tier memory and processing limits
- Yahoo Finance API rate limiting
- Existing database schema compatibility
- Maintain 100% test coverage

### Business Constraints
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Maintain data accuracy
- Clear user communication about data freshness
- Graceful degradation during API failures

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics
- Dashboard load time: <3 seconds (90% improvement)
- API call reduction: >99.5% (from ~19,690 to <100)
- Cache hit rate: >95% (45% improvement)
- Error rate: <1% (significant improvement)

### User Experience
- No application errors due to timeouts
- Clear data freshness visibility
- Responsive UI during background updates
- Intuitive progress indicators

### Technical Quality
- All 233+ tests continue to pass
- Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- Comprehensive documentation
- Monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Implementation Strategy

This implementation will follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:
1. Write failing tests for each optimization
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. Refactor for performance and maintainability
4. Validate against performance targets

The approach prioritizes incremental improvements with continuous validation to ensure no regressions while achieving significant performance gains.
