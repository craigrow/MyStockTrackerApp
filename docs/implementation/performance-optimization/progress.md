## TDD Cycle Documentation

### Current Status
- **Phase**: Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation
- **Next Step**: Wait for devR changes to merge to main, then begin Phase 1
- **Tests Status**: All 233 existing tests passing
- **Branch**: devQ (synced with main)
- **Implementation Strategy**: Full TDD approach with all 4 phases
- **Approach Confirmed**: ✅ User approved phased approach and TDD strategy

## Implementation Readiness

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Performance bottleneck analysis
- [x] Implementation plan creation
- [x] Test strategy design
- [x] Risk mitigation planning
- [x] User approval of approach

### ✅ Ready to Begin Implementation
- [x] devR changes (cash flows feature) merged to main
- [x] devQ synced with updated main (288 tests passing)
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 implementation

## Technical Challenges Encountered

*None yet - waiting for devR merge before starting implementation*

## Performance Metrics Tracking

### Baseline Metrics (Current)
- Dashboard Load Time: 27+ seconds
- API Calls per Load: ~19,690
- Cache Hit Rate: ~50%
- Error Rate: High (timeouts)

### Target Metrics
- Dashboard Load Time: <3 seconds
- API Calls per Load: <100
- Cache Hit Rate: >95%
- Error Rate: <1%

### Progress Tracking
*Will be updated as implementation progresses*

## Notes and Decisions

- Using interactive mode for collaborative development
- Following TDD principles throughout implementation
- Maintaining all existing functionality while optimizing
- Prioritizing incremental improvements with continuous validation
