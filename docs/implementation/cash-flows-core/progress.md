# Cash Flows Core Implementation - Progress

## Setup Phase
- [x] Verify dependencies (fs_read, fs_write, execute_bash)
- [x] Create directory structure (docs/implementation/cash-flows-core/)
- [x] Discover existing instruction files
- [x] Create context.md with project overview
- [x] Create progress.md for tracking
- [ ] Complete setup phase

## Explore Phase
- [x] Analyze requirements and context
- [x] Research existing patterns
- [x] Update code context document

## Plan Phase  
- [x] Design test strategy
- [x] Implementation planning & tracking

## Code Phase
- [x] Implement test cases (22 new tests added)
- [x] Develop implementation code (CashFlow/IRR models and services)
- [x] Refactor and optimize (proper IRR calculation with scipy)
- [x] Validate implementation (255 total tests passing)

## Commit Phase
- [ ] Draft conventional commit message
- [ ] Execute git commit

## Implementation Checklist

### Database Models
- [x] CashFlow model with all required fields
- [x] IRRCalculation model for storing calculations
- [x] Portfolio model extensions (cash_flows, irr_calculations relationships, hash field)
- [x] Database schema migration (table creation completed)

### Services
- [x] CashFlowService for core business logic
- [x] IRRCalculationService for IRR calculations
- [x] Data synchronization service (hash-based validation)
- [x] Page-level integration (dashboard and cash flows routes)

### UI Components
- [x] Cash Flows tab in navigation
- [x] Cash flow table component with responsive design
- [x] Summary metrics cards (Total Invested, IRR, etc.)
- [x] Route handlers for cash flows
- [x] Dashboard integration (View Cash Flows button)
- [x] Breadcrumb navigation
- [x] Mobile-responsive layout

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for CashFlow model (6 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for IRRCalculation model (3 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for CashFlowService (8 tests)
- [x] Unit tests for IRRCalculationService (8 tests)
- [x] Data synchronization tests (8 tests)
- [x] UI integration tests (5 tests)

### Integration
- [ ] Cash flow generation from transactions
- [ ] Cash flow generation from dividends
- [ ] IRR calculation integration
- [ ] UI integration with existing navigation

## Notes

### Setup Notes
- Project uses Python 3.12 + Flask + SQLAlchemy
- 233 existing tests all passing on both main and devR branches
- No DEVELOPMENT.md found, using README.md conventions
- Working on devR branch, deploying to devR environment

### Technical Decisions
- Using scipy for IRR calculation (Newton-Raphson method)
- Following existing model patterns for database schema
- Integrating with existing PortfolioService architecture
- Using Bootstrap 5 for UI consistency
