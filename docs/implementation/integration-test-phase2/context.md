# Integration Test Phase 2 - Context Document

## Phase 2 Overview: Data Integrity & Edge Cases

### Strategic Focus
Build upon Phase 1's foundation to ensure **data accuracy** and **robust error handling** across complex scenarios that could cause data corruption or system failures.

### Phase 2 Scope
- **CSV Import Workflows**: Complete import process validation
- **Multi-Portfolio Edge Cases**: Complex data interactions and isolation
- **ETF Calculation Accuracy**: Financial calculation precision
- **Market Hours Behavior**: Time-sensitive functionality
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failure scenarios

## Requirements Analysis

### 1. CSV Import Workflows
**Critical Scenarios:**
- Valid CSV import with mixed data types
- Duplicate detection and prevention (builds on existing functionality)
- Invalid data handling and user feedback
- Large file processing performance
- Partial import recovery scenarios

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CSV imports handle all valid formats correctly
- Duplicate detection prevents data corruption
- Invalid rows are reported with clear error messages
- System remains stable during large imports
- Users can recover from partial import failures

### 2. Multi-Portfolio Edge Cases
**Critical Scenarios:**
- Portfolio data isolation (no cross-contamination)
- Concurrent portfolio operations
- Portfolio deletion with transaction cleanup
- Performance with many portfolios (10+ portfolios)
- Portfolio switching under load

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each portfolio's data remains completely isolated
- System handles multiple portfolios efficiently
- Data cleanup works correctly on portfolio deletion
- Performance remains acceptable with scale
- No data mixing between portfolios

### 3. ETF Calculation Accuracy
**Critical Scenarios:**
- VOO/QQQ performance calculations match manual verification
- Edge cases: weekends, holidays, market closures
- Historical date alignment for fair comparisons
- Precision in financial calculations (no rounding errors)
- Performance calculation consistency

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ETF calculations accurate to 2 decimal places
- Handles market closure dates correctly
- Historical comparisons use same time periods
- No accumulating rounding errors
- Consistent results across multiple calculations

### 4. Market Hours Behavior
**Critical Scenarios:**
- Different caching behavior during market open vs closed
- Data freshness warnings during trading hours
- Weekend and holiday handling
- Time zone considerations
- Cache invalidation timing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Appropriate caching strategy based on market status
- Accurate data freshness warnings
- Correct handling of non-trading days
- Time zone calculations work correctly
- Cache invalidation happens at right times

### 5. Error Recovery Scenarios
**Critical Scenarios:**
- Yahoo Finance API failures and timeouts
- Database connection issues and recovery
- Malformed data handling
- Network interruption recovery
- Partial operation failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System gracefully handles API failures
- Database connection issues don't corrupt data
- Malformed data doesn't crash the system
- Network issues are handled transparently
- Partial failures can be recovered or rolled back

## Implementation Strategy

### Test Infrastructure Extensions
- **CSV Test Data Generators**: Realistic CSV files with various scenarios
- **Multi-Portfolio Factories**: Complex portfolio setups
- **Financial Calculation Validators**: Precision testing utilities
- **Error Simulation Tools**: Controlled failure injection
- **Market Time Mocking**: Time-sensitive behavior testing

### Integration with Phase 1
- **Reuse existing mocking system** for performance
- **Extend test factories** for complex scenarios
- **Build on assertion helpers** for data validation
- **Leverage performance helpers** for scale testing

### Test Execution Strategy
- **Fast tests** for data validation logic
- **Slower tests** for complex scenarios (with appropriate timeouts)
- **Isolated tests** to prevent data contamination
- **Cleanup procedures** to maintain test independence

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- All CSV import scenarios work correctly
- Multi-portfolio operations are completely isolated
- ETF calculations are financially accurate
- Market hours behavior is appropriate
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully

### Quality Requirements
- Tests execute reliably and consistently
- Clear failure messages for debugging
- No test data contamination between runs
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Foundation ready for Phase 3

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Integrity Risks
- **Test Isolation**: Each test uses clean database state
- **Realistic Test Data**: Mirror production scenarios
- **Precision Validation**: Financial calculations tested to required precision
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Proper test data cleanup

### Performance Risks
- **Selective Mocking**: Mock expensive operations while testing logic
- **Timeout Management**: Appropriate timeouts for complex operations
- **Resource Cleanup**: Prevent resource leaks in tests
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient test data generation
