# MyStockTrackerApp - High-Level Design Document (Updated)
*Updated: June 22, 2025*

## 1. Executive Summary

MyStockTrackerApp is a production-ready web application that helps investors track the performance of their stock purchases against major market ETFs. The system allows users to manually enter stock purchases, sales, and dividends, organize them into multiple portfolios, and visualize performance comparisons against benchmark ETFs (VOO for S&P 500, QQQ for NASDAQ).

**Key Innovation**: The application tracks the performance of individual stock transactions, not just aggregate positions. This approach accounts for the fact that positions are typically established over time through multiple purchases, providing more accurate performance analysis.

**✅ PRODUCTION STATUS**: The application has achieved 100% test coverage (102/102 tests passing) and includes advanced features that significantly exceed the original requirements, including intelligent daily performance tracking, comprehensive CSV import/export, and market-aware caching systems.
