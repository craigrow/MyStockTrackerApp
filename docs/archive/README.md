## Why These Were Archived

These documents were moved to archive because:

1. **Development Summaries**: Historical records from June 2025 that don't provide current value for new agents
2. **Strategy Documents**: Superseded by the comprehensive AGENT_ONBOARDING.md system
3. **Implementation Plans**: Outdated plans that don't reflect current architecture
4. **Redundant Docs**: Duplicate information now consolidated in active documentation
5. **Historical Analysis**: Documents that served their purpose but are no longer needed for current development
6. **Temporary Records**: Documentation created for specific cleanup activities

## Current Documentation
