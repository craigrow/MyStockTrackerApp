## üöÄ Development Environment Options

### Primary Workflow: Rapid UAT Development

**This is our standard development approach** - fast iteration in test environments followed by production CI/CD.

**Use Case**: Primary development workflow  
**Deployment Time**: ~2-3 minutes  
**Requirements**: None for UAT testing, full tests before CI/CD  

**UAT Environment Naming:**
- **devR branch work**: `mystocktrackerapp-testr`
- **devQ branch work**: `mystocktrackerapp-testq`
- Simple, clear naming - one test environment per development branch  

#### Complete Development Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Sync with origin
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout devR && git pull origin devR

# 2. Create feature branch and make changes
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# ... implement your changes using code-assist script ...

# 3. Deploy to rapid UAT environment for testing
heroku create mystocktrackerapp-testr
git push heroku feature/my-feature:main

# 4. Iterate and test in UAT environment
# ... make changes, commit, push to heroku, test, repeat ...

# 5. When satisfied with UAT testing, run full test suite locally
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# 6. If tests pass, push to GitHub to initiate CI/CD
git checkout devR
git merge feature/my-feature
git push origin devR
# This triggers automated CI/CD pipeline

# 7. Clean up UAT environment
heroku apps:destroy mystocktrackerapp-testr
```

#### When to Use This Workflow:
- ‚úÖ **All development work** (this is the primary approach)
- ‚úÖ Feature development and testing
- ‚úÖ Bug fixes and improvements
- ‚úÖ UI/UX changes
- ‚úÖ API integration work
- ‚úÖ Performance optimizations

### Alternative: Direct CI/CD Pipeline (For Simple Changes)

**Use Case**: Simple, well-understood changes that don't need UAT iteration  
**Deployment Time**: ~30 minutes (includes full test suite)  
**Requirements**: 100% test pass rate (339/339 tests)

#### Direct CI/CD Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Sync with main (CRITICAL)
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout devR && git merge main

# 2. Use code-assist script for development
# ... make changes and run tests locally ...

# 3. Deploy through CI/CD pipeline
git push origin devR
# Wait for CI/CD, approve UAT, automatic production deployment
```

#### When to Use Direct CI/CD:
- ‚úÖ Simple bug fixes with obvious solutions
- ‚úÖ Documentation updates
- ‚úÖ Configuration changes
- ‚úÖ Changes you're confident about without UAT iteration

#### When NOT to Use Direct CI/CD:
- ‚ùå New features requiring iteration
- ‚ùå UI/UX changes needing visual testing
- ‚ùå Complex logic requiring debugging
- ‚ùå Integration work with external APIs
- ‚ùå Performance optimizations needing measurement

### Option 2: Full CI/CD Pipeline (Existing - For Production Quality)

**Use Case**: Production-ready deployments  
**Deployment Time**: ~30 minutes (includes full test suite)  
**Requirements**: 100% test pass rate (339/339 tests)

#### Production Environments:
1. **Main** is deployed here: https://mystocktrackerapp-prod-32618c8b4af1.herokuapp.com/ (Production)
2. **devQ** is deployed here: https://mystocktrackerapp-devq-6cb9ce7e7076.herokuapp.com/ (Development)
3. **devR** is deployed here: https://mystocktrackerapp-devr-607807562777.herokuapp.com/dashboard (Development)

#### When to Use:
- ‚úÖ Final testing before production
- ‚úÖ Features that affect core business logic
- ‚úÖ Changes that require comprehensive testing
- ‚úÖ Production deployments
- ‚úÖ Code that will be used by real users

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Production Deployment Policy

**DIRECT DEPLOYMENTS TO PRODUCTION ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED**

All production deployments MUST follow the established CI/CD workflow with mandatory UAT approval:
1. Changes must be pushed to devQ or devR branches only
2. Automated tests must pass (100%)
3. Dev environment deployment must be successful
4. UAT approval must be explicitly granted via GitHub Actions interface
5. Only after UAT approval can changes be merged to main and deployed to production

**EMERGENCY ROLLBACKS:** In case of critical production issues, follow the emergency rollback procedure in `docs/emergency_rollback_procedure.md` which requires explicit approval and documentation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Branch Synchronization Protocol

**ALWAYS sync your development branch with main before starting work to prevent merge conflicts:**

### For Production Pipeline (devQ/devR):
```bash
# Before starting ANY development work:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout devQ  # or devR
git merge main     # Sync with latest main changes

# If merge conflicts occur, resolve them BEFORE coding
# Then proceed with development
```

**After GitHub Actions deployment completes:**
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Sync local repo with GitHub after automated deployment
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout devQ && git pull origin devQ
# GitHub Actions merges branches on GitHub, not locally
```

### For Rapid UAT Environments:
```bash
# No special branch requirements - work from any branch
git checkout -b feature/quick-test
# ... make changes ...
git push heroku feature/quick-test:main
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents merge conflicts during automated deployments
- Ensures your branch has the latest production changes
- Avoids deployment failures in GitHub Actions
- Maintains clean git history
- **Local repo can be out of sync after GitHub Actions automated merges**

## üéØ Recommended Workflows for AI Agents

### Primary Workflow: Rapid UAT Development (Use This for Most Work)
```bash
# 1. Sync with origin
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout devR && git pull origin devR

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 3. Use code-assist script for development
# Parameters:
# - task_description: "Your feature description"
# - mode: "interactive" (recommended)
# - repo_root: current directory
# - documentation_dir: "docs"

# 4. Deploy to UAT environment for testing
heroku create mystocktrackerapp-testr
git push heroku feature/my-feature:main

# 5. Iterate and test in UAT environment
# ... make changes, commit, push to heroku, test, repeat ...
# This is where you do most of your development and debugging

# 6. When satisfied with UAT testing, run full test suite locally
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# 7. If tests pass, push to GitHub to initiate CI/CD
git checkout devR
git merge feature/my-feature
git push origin devR
# This triggers automated CI/CD pipeline

# 8. Clean up UAT environment
heroku apps:destroy mystocktrackerapp-testr
```

### Alternative Workflow: Direct CI/CD (For Simple Changes Only)
```bash
# 1. Sync with main (CRITICAL)
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout devR && git merge main

# 2. Use code-assist script for development
# Parameters:
# - task_description: "Your feature description"
# - mode: "interactive"
# - repo_root: current directory
# - documentation_dir: "docs"

# 3. Run tests locally
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# 4. Deploy through CI/CD pipeline
git push origin devR
# Wait for CI/CD, approve UAT, automatic production deployment
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Code-Assist Script Integration

### For ANY Coding Task:
1. **Use the code-assist script** - This is MANDATORY, not optional
2. **Choose appropriate mode based on development track**

### Standard Parameters:
```
- task_description: "What you need to implement"
- repo_root: "/Users/craigrow/craigrow_code/MyStockTrackerApp_R"
- documentation_dir: "docs"
```

### Mode Selection:
**For Primary Rapid UAT Workflow:**
- `mode`: "interactive" (recommended for most development)
- Develop with UAT iteration and testing
- Run full tests before CI/CD push
- Complete documentation for production changes

**For Direct CI/CD (Simple Changes):**
- `mode`: "interactive" 
- Full TDD workflow with comprehensive testing
- Complete documentation and validation
- Thorough code review process

## üìù Documentation Maintenance Requirements

### When to Update CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md:
**REQUIRED for Production Pipeline:**
- ‚úÖ New features or major functionality changes
- ‚úÖ Architecture or data model changes  
- ‚úÖ New API endpoints or services
- ‚úÖ Performance optimizations or caching changes
- ‚úÖ New dependencies or technology additions

**NOT REQUIRED for:**
- ‚ùå Bug fixes that don't change functionality
- ‚ùå UI/styling changes without logic changes
- ‚ùå Test additions or improvements
- ‚ùå Minor refactoring without architectural impact
- ‚ùå Rapid UAT experiments (unless transitioning to production)

### How to Update:
1. **Add new sections** for new features/services
2. **Update existing sections** for modified functionality  
3. **Update metrics** (test counts, performance numbers)
4. **Keep it current** - reflect the actual implementation state

### Documentation Update Process:
```bash
# After implementing changes in production pipeline:
1. Update CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md with your changes
2. Commit documentation updates with your code changes
3. Include documentation updates in your commit message
   Example: "feat: add portfolio export feature + update docs"
```
