   - Verify API call reduction from ~19,690 to <100 per dashboard load
   - Validate cache hit rate improvement from ~50% to >95%
   - Confirm elimination of timeout errors

2. **Verify Functional Correctness**:
   - Ensure all existing features work correctly after optimization
   - Validate data accuracy when using cached vs. real-time data
   - Verify correct operation of new background processing features
   - Ensure data freshness indicators accurately reflect data state

3. **Validate User Experience**:
   - Verify users never see application errors due to performance issues
   - Confirm proper display of loading/progress indicators
   - Validate graceful degradation when API services are unavailable
   - Ensure clear communication of data freshness to users
