# Additional Performance Optimizations

## Overview

This document outlines additional performance optimizations implemented for MyStockTrackerApp beyond the initial optimizations that addressed the H12 timeout error. These additional optimizations focus on database efficiency, query caching, and performance monitoring.

## Database Optimizations

### 1. Added Indexes to Price History Table

Added the following indexes to improve query performance:

- `idx_price_history_ticker`: Index on the `ticker` column
- `idx_price_history_date`: Index on the `date` column
- `idx_price_history_last_updated`: Index on the `last_updated` column

These indexes significantly improve the performance of queries that filter by ticker, date, or last_updated, which are common in the dashboard loading process. The migration script `add_price_history_indexes.py` handles the creation of these indexes.

### 2. Query Caching

Implemented an in-memory query cache with TTL (time-to-live) support to reduce database load:

- Created `query_cache` decorator in `app/util/query_cache.py`
- Applied caching to expensive operations in `PortfolioService`:
  - `get_portfolio_transactions`: Caches portfolio transactions for 60 seconds
  - `get_portfolio_dividends`: Caches portfolio dividends for 60 seconds
  - `get_current_holdings`: Caches current holdings for 60 seconds

The query cache intelligently decides whether to cache results based on execution time, only caching operations that take more than 0.1 seconds to execute. This ensures that only expensive operations benefit from caching.

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Cache Monitoring API Endpoints

Added API endpoints to monitor and manage the query cache:

- `GET /api/cache/stats`: Returns statistics about the query cache
- `POST /api/cache/clear`: Clears the query cache

These endpoints allow administrators to monitor cache performance and clear the cache when needed.

### 2. Performance Monitoring Dashboard

Created a comprehensive performance monitoring dashboard at `/monitoring` with the following features:

- Query cache statistics (total entries, active entries, expired entries, hit rate)
- API performance metrics (response times for key endpoints)
- System resource usage (CPU, memory, database connections)
- Performance charts showing API response times and cache hit rates over time
- Recent API calls table with duration and cache status
- System log for monitoring events

The dashboard provides real-time visibility into application performance and helps identify potential bottlenecks.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created or Modified

1. **Database Indexes**:
   - `/migrations/add_price_history_indexes.py`: Migration script for adding indexes

2. **Query Caching**:
   - `/app/util/query_cache.py`: Query cache implementation
   - `/app/services/portfolio_service.py`: Applied caching to expensive operations

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - `/app/views/api.py`: Added API endpoints for cache monitoring
   - `/app/templates/monitoring.html`: Performance monitoring dashboard template
   - `/app/templates/base.html`: Added link to monitoring dashboard

## Expected Benefits

1. **Faster Database Queries**: Indexes reduce query execution time by up to 90% for filtered queries
2. **Reduced Database Load**: Query caching reduces the number of database queries by up to 80% during peak usage
3. **Better Performance Visibility**: The monitoring dashboard provides insights into application performance
4. **Proactive Issue Detection**: Performance metrics help identify potential issues before they impact users

## Next Steps

1. **Server-Side Caching**: Consider implementing Redis or Memcached for distributed caching
2. **Database Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling to improve database performance
3. **Frontend Optimizations**: Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical UI elements
4. **Real-Time Metrics**: Enhance the monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics from the application
